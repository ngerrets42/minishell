# minishell
A partial imitation of the UNIX Bash shell.

**According to the 42 subject:**

"The objective of this project is for you to create a simple shell.
The existence of shells is linked to the very existence of IT.
At the time, all developers agreed that communicating with a computer using aligned 1/0 switcheswas seriously irritating.
It was only logical that they came up with the idea of creating a software to communicate with acomputer using interactive lines of commands in a language somewhat close to the human language.
Thanks to Minishell, you’ll be able to travel through time and come back to problems peoplefaced when Windows didn’t exist."
